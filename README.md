GRID aims to establish a technology foundation for the FURY Network, to facilitate the construction of the next-generation of distributed sports and gaming applications. By incorporating a comprehensive service infrastructure and an enhanced IBC protocol into the Tendermint & Cosmos stack, GRID enables service interoperability as well as token transfers across an internet of blockchains.

As the centerpiece of the FURY Network, GRID (a.k.a. GRIDhub) will be the first dedicated sports and gaming hub connecting to the main Cosmos Hub, thus making GRID and the FURY Network an inseparable part of the whole Cosmos network.

The FURY Network, is a blockchain designed to support the future of sports betting & related gaming by leveraging the modular Cosmos-SDK design. We believe the future will be heavily shaped by many of the values driving the recent wave of crypto and blockchain development: transparency, increased decentralization, and utility that benefits all stakeholders, especially the user-base.

Utilizing a sovereign blockchain uniquely enables:

An adaptable framework to design custom applications.
Enablement of features, tools and economic models where users can directly benefit from the value they help create.
An unparalleled level of transparency.
An efficiency of settlement and immediate payout to participants.
At launch, the FURY Network will be optimized to deploy an inaugural application: FURY Network, which is re-imagining the sports betting landscape and bringing a unique user experience with the benefit of blockchain technology. Please visit to learn more about FURY Network.
